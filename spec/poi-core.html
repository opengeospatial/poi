				<p>This document describes a data model and XML syntax for representing information about points of interest (POI).</p>
				<p>In the most broad terms, a "point of interest" is a location about which information of general interest is available. A POI can be as simple as a set of coordinates and an identifier, or more complex such as a three dimensional model of a building with names in various languages, information about open and closed hours, and a civic address. POI data has many uses including navigation systems, mapping, geocaching, location-based social networking games, and augmented reality browsers.</p>
				<p>POI data has traditionally been exchanged in proprietary formats by various transport mechanisms. This specification defines a flexible, lightweight, extensible POI data model. This will enable content publishers to effectively describe and efficiently serve and exchange POI data.</p>
				<p>To achieve these goals, this document describes a generic data model that may be instantiated in a variety of serializations, including XML, JSON and RDF.</p>
				<p>Here is an example of a simple POI serialized in XML:</p>
				<pre>

		<section id="terms">
			<h1 id="Terms">Terms and Definitions</h1>
			<p>
				This document uses the terms defined in Sub-clause 5.3 of [OGC 06-121r8], which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply.
			</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>
					Location
				</dt>
				<dd>
					The term location is used to refer to an identifiable geographic place <a href="#ISO19112">[ISO19112]</a>. Typically a location is a physically fixed point, typically on the surface of the Earth, though locations can be relative to other, non-earth centric coordinate reference systems. Locations can be a single point, a centroid, a minimum bounding rectangle, or a set of vectors. A location should be persistent over time and does not change. Multiple POIs <em>may</em> share the same location. When a POI physically moves it is understood to have acquired a new location.
				</dd>
				<dt>
					Points of Interest
				</dt>
				<dd>
					Unlike the term location, the term POI is a human construct. POIs typically describe a location where one can find a place, product or service, typically identified by name rather than by address and characterized by type, which <em>may</em> be used as a reference point or a target in a location based service request, e.g., as the destination of a route. For the purposes of this document, the term POI does not exclude the labeling, identification, and tracking of persons and other physical objects that have no permanent location.
				</dd>
				<dt>
					Places
				</dt>
				<dd>
					A place is also a human construct which typically has a coarse level of spatial granularity. Places are generally larger scale administrative constructs, either informally or formally defined. Countries, states, counties, districts, neighborhoods and postal codes or telephone area codes are all places. Places are also informally or colloquially defined, such as the Home Counties in the United Kingdom and the Bay Area in the United States. + Places have spatial relationships; with parents, children, adjacencies and contained by semantics. Places have the same attribute set as POIs, although often with differing interpretations based on scale; for example, the address of a Place or its URI might refer to the address of the administrative or governing body of the place. + A place typically contains multiple POIs and can also be coterminous with a POI. In the former case, a place, such as a city or a neighborhood, will contain multiple POIs. In the latter case, a place and a POI will occupy the same position and extent, such as in the case of Yellowstone National Park, which is both a Place and a POI. For the purposes of this document no distinction will be made between a place and a POI.
				</dd>
				<dt>
					Coordinate
				</dt>
				<dd>
					The term coordinate refers to one of a sequence of n numbers designating the position of a point in n-dimensional space <a href="#ISO19111">[ISO19111]</a>.
				</dd>
				<dt>
					Coordinate Reference System
				</dt>
				<dd>
					The term coordinate reference system refers to a coordinate system that is related to an object by a datum <a href="#ISO19111">[ISO19111]</a>.
				</dd>
				<dt>
					Coordinate System
				</dt>
				<dd>
					The term coordinate system refers to a set of mathematical rules for specifying how coordinates are to be assigned to points <a href="#ISO19111">[ISO19111]</a>.
				</dd>
				<dt>
					Datum
				</dt>
				<dd>
					The term datum refers to a parameter or set of parameters that define the position of the origin, the scale, and the orientation of a coordinate system <a href="#ISO19111">[ISO19111]</a>.
				</dd>
				<dt>
					Geolocation
				</dt>
				<dd>
					The term geolocation refers to the identification of the real world geographic location of an object.
				</dd>
				<dt>
					Point
				</dt>
				<dd>
					The term point refers to a 0-dimensional geometric primitive, representing a position <a href="#ISO19107">[ISO19107]</a>.
				</dd>
				<dt>
					Position
				</dt>
				<dd>
					The term position refers to a data type that describes a point or geometry potentially occupied by an object or person <a href="#ISO19133">[ISO19133]</a>.
				</dd>
				<dt>
					Route
				</dt>
				<dd>
					The term route refers to a sequence of links and / or partial links that describe a path, usually between two positions, within a network <a href="#ISO19133">[ISO19133]</a>.
				</dd>
				<dt>
					Coordinate Set
				</dt>
				<dd>
					The term coordinate set refers to the individual parts of a coordinate. This is often a simple coordinate pair of latitude and longitude values, but based on the coordinate system used, <em>may</em> be other values, see <a href="#coordinate_reference_systems">[coordinate_reference_systems]</a>.

				POI Conceptual Model (Informative)
			</h1>
			<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
			<div class="sectionbody">
				<p>This clause specifies the underlying POI conceptual model for which an encoding can be created. It defines the mandatory requirements for  encoding and the necessary semantics of how that encoding should be interpreted.
				</p>
			</div>	
			<h2 id="conceptualmodel">Core Conceptual Model</h2>
			<div class="sectionbody">
				<p>
					The Point of Interest data model consists of a <strong><a href="#poi">POI</a></strong> object and a <strong><a href="#pois">POIS</a></strong> grouping object. Each POI has a number of properties described in the <strong><a href="#poiproperties">POIProperties</a></strong> object for capturing descriptive information, along with a <strong><a href="#location">Location</a></strong> object describing its location and a <strong><a href="#position">Position</a></strong> object describing its geometry and positional accuracy. In order to maximize the flexibility with which POI, POIs and their sub-entities can be described, each inherit its properties from a single common object. In practical terms, this allows properties such as update time, authorship, links and other categorizations to be described at multiple levels of granularity within the data model.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="image"><img src="graphics/poi_model.svg" alt="UML model of the POI core data model"></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					The classes of the core data model are described in more detail below.
				</p>
			</div>

					
					<h2 id="poiconceptual">POI</h2>
					<p>
						A POI is defined as having the following conceptual properties:
					</p>
						<ul>
							<li>a globally unique ID</li>
							<li>labels</li>
							<li>descriptions</li>
							<li>location</li>
							<li>tags/keywords/categories</li>
							<li>links to related information</li>
							<li>time</li>
							<li>authors</li>
							<li>rights</li>
							<li>metadata</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
						While a POI may be near meaningless without a label and location, from a computational perspective there are use cases in which any of these properties should be optional. Therefore, the only mandatory characteristic of a POI is that it have a globally unique identification property in the format of a URI.
					</p>
				<div class="sect2">
					<h2 id="labelsdescriptionsconceptual">
						Labels and Descriptions
					</h2>
					<p>
						Labels (place names) and descriptions are largely self-explanatory properties. A place may have multiple labels, as it may be known differently by different people, in different languages or in different times or contexts. Multiple descriptions are important for the same reasons.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sect2">
					<h2 id="locationconceptual">
						Location
					</h2>
					<p>
						The most common way of expressing the location of a POI is as a point defined by latitude and longitude coordinates in decimal degrees. This specification enhances that basic definition, allowing a POI’s location to be determined by either a point, line, polygon or civic address. A POI may also use more than one location definition property to more clearly specify multiple locational concepts, such as a building’s address, boundary, centroid, and entrance. A POI is most useful when its location is well-known, but this is not always possible, so the model supports the ability to express location relative to other POIs. This feature may be used alone, or in addition to, an absolute location.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sect2">
					<h2 id="categoriesconceptual">
						Categories
					</h2>
					<p>
						Tagging, or categorizing a POI is a common practice in wide use by personal navigation systems, government gazetteers such as the USGS Geographic Names Information System, and businesses like Yelp!. Therefore the POI specification supports structured categorization, where the identifying term comes from a dictionary - or registry of terms - and it also supports "free" tagging, where the identifying term is simply that - a word or phrase with no reference to a structured information model.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sect2">
					<h2 id="linksconceptual">
						Links
					</h2>
					<p>
						Links to related information allow a POI reference content that may exist in external repositories, such as images, web pages, maps, reviews, 3D models, and even other POI data repositories.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sect2">
					<h2 id="timeconceptual">
						Time
					</h2>
					<p>
						Time plays an important role as no place stays the same forever. A POI may have a start time and/or an end time. The POI data record (and also all its child properties) may also have start, end and last updated time stamps.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sect2">
					<h2 id="authorsrightsconceptual">
						Authors and Rights
					</h2>
					<p>
						Identifying authors and licensing terms are important aspects of any information sharing system. These two are so important that they are separated from any more universal metadata definition system used by the following mechanism.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sect2">
					<h2 id="metadataconceptual">

						Metadata and provenance is a such a broad, generic area of work that one approach could not work for all POIs. Therefore, if a POI contains metadata it must also define the metadata information model it uses.

						Property Inheritance
					</h2>
					<p>
						In many cases, POI information is nested in a heirarchical system. Any property of a POI applies to all its child properties, unless that property is re-defined in the child. For example, if a POI has an author property of "A", and the POI has a description property of "D", the author of D is A, unless D has an author property itself. Then the author of D is whatever D defines it to be. One useful feature of inheritance is that if only one property of a POI has a different author, it is easy to express that fact precisely without adding a lot of duplicative author information to every property in the POI.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sect2">
					<h2 id="poisconceptual">
						POIS
					</h2>
					<p>
						Multiple POIs may be grouped into a POIS object, which serves only as a container object such that a group of POIs can inherit properties - for example authorship, licensing or categorization. The POIS object is expected to be useful only as a dynamic aggregation mechanism when information is being shared between systems. It is not expected to be of any particular use as a way to permanently model POI information in a database.

					<h2 id="category">category</h2>
					<p>
						The category property classifies the POI using keywords. Category is adopted from the atom:category object <a href="#RFC4087">[RFC4087]</a>, and works in much the same way. A category should specify the type of POI, such as city, restaurant, etc. The category’s value property is the keyword, or tag. The <a href="#term">term</a>, if specified, is the classification scheme to which the value belongs. To emulate a "folksonomy" or "free tagging", the term <em>shall</em> be "free". This tagging system <em>may</em> be more formally structured using the scheme property to specify a dictionary of terms or a web resource containing definitions of the terms and values.
					</p>
					<p>
						Multiple categories are allowed to accommodate the fact that POIs may be more than one thing. For example, a casino might be a gambling hall, a restaurant, and a concert venue. A grocery store may also be a bank and a pharmacy.
					</p>
					<p>
						The href property <em>may</em> be used to provide a resolvable link to a more comprehensive definition of the category.

						A link to another POI, or any other web resource.

A link is a generic way to define a relationship between the POI and other Web-accessible resources.
					</p>
					<p>
						Links are a powerful way to describe a host of relationships. One could argue that just as Web pages obtain most of their value by the links between them, a POI’s value is directly related to the number of links between it and others. Links in POIs are perhaps even more important than links in Web pages or Atom feeds, as POIs are inherently place-based objects with natural relationships in space and time that should be expressed. Those spatial relationships are mostly covered by the <a href="#relationship">relationship</a> property, which is in many ways a specialization of the generic Link. But there are many more semi-spatial and non-spatial relationships that can be expressed using link.
					</p>
					<p>
						This specification proposes a number of best practices for defining links. Key relations from the IANA registry are listed below in italics. Those relations in bold are defined only in this specification.

					<p>
						In all of the entities that specify geodetic coordinates, an srsName property is included in order to indicate the coordinate reference system (CRS) being used. The srsName value is a URI <a href="#RFC3986">[RFC3986]</a> indicating the CRS used and is <a href="http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326">http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326</a> by default. This default is the URI for the World Geodetic System 84 (WGS84) in 2 dimensions, latitude and longitude. Other CRS URNs are allowed. In particular, the URI <a href="http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4979">http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4979</a> indicates WGS84 in 3 dimensions, latitude, longitude and elevation in meters above sea level. The CRS used influences the interpretation of the coordinate set.
					</p>
					<p>
						The default CRS refers to WGS84 geographic longitude and latitude expressed in decimal degrees, namely EPSG 4326, without the degrees symbol, "°". The values of latitude and longitude are bounded by ±90° and ±180° respectively. Positive latitudes are north of the equator, negative latitudes are south of the equator. Positive longitudes are east of the Prime Meridian, negative longitudes are west of the Prime Meridian. Latitude and longitude are expressed in that sequence, namely latitude before longitude.
					</p>
					<p>
						Implementations are required to support the following CRS based on WGS 84 NIMA.TR8350.2-3e <a href="#NIMA-TR8350-2">[NIMA-TR8350-2]</a>. These are identified using the European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) Geodetic Parameter Dataset, as formalized by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC):
					</p>
					<div>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326:">http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326:</a> 2 dimensional WGS 84, latitude, and longitude</li>
							<li><a href="http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4979:">http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4979:</a> 3 dimensional WGS 84, latitude, longitude, altitude</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p>
						The most recent version of the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset should be used. A CRS must be specified using the above URI notation only, implementations do not need to support user-defined CRSs. This specification does not assign responsibilities for coordinate transformations from and to other Coordinate Reference Systems.
					</p>
